## Conclusion
The Beatroute Integration module is working correctly. All four sections (SKUs, Customers, Invoices, and Payments) correctly display both local data and live data from Beatroute. The sync functionality works as expected, allowing users to synchronize data between Beatroute and the local database.

The implementation of the live data sections provides users with a clear view of the current data in Beatroute, making it easy to identify discrepancies between the local database and Beatroute.
